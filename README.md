In the present work, a comparison was made from network science to the human connectome of men and women, this through the establishment of consensus connectomes which incorporated the links present in at least a certain percentage of the population. It was found that regardless of the consensus, the connectome of men exhibits greater segregation and that of women greater integration, in turn, the connectome of men is more asymmetric and non-random. It was found that in terms of local connectivity the connections of men and women do not seem to differ significantly, however in terms of global connectivity they exhibit clear differences.
